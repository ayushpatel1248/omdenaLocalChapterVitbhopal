                        Bhopal is also known as “The City of Lakes”, which indicates
                        that Bhopal has a significant quantity of Lakes. People who
                        live in the area are constantly in contact with chemicals
                        assimilated in the water bodies during Gas Tragedy. Surveys
                        done by the Bhopal campaign groups have shown that their
                        environment contains six of the persistent organic
                        pollutants banned by the United Nations for their highly
                        poisonous impacts on the environment and human health,
                        which has now reached 42 areas in Bhopal and continues to
                        spread. According to the Surveyors, the situation is getting
                        worse, and second and third-generation children are being
                        born with disabilities. <br>
                        The approach is divided into 5 main
                        tasks: Planning and Analysis of
                        Concerned Area, Data acquisition, Data
                        Analysis, and Dashboard Building and

                        Firstly, We analyzed all the significant
                        lakes present in Bhopal, which is utilized
                        highly by the public, then we distributed
                        all these lakes between our teams and
                        then the task of collecting data using
                        satellite Landstat and Sentinal which can
                        be accessed using Google Earth Engine
                        was in progress. This Collection of data
                        was done from 2014-2023. After the
                        collection of data, Analysis of every single
                        parameter that was obtained was
                        performed, which make us understand
                        what is the quality of Water inside
                        Bhopal, after the Gas Tragedy.

                <h1>Technology and
                    resources used</h1>
                <p>
                    Our water quality monitoring project utilizes
                    cutting-edge technology to assess and track
                    water quality parameters. By harnessing the
                    power of Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloudbased platform, we can analyze vast amounts
                    of geospatial data, including satellite imagery
                    and geospatial datasets. GEE enables us to
                    detect changes in water quality by analyzing
                    spectral signatures, allowing for the
                    identification of areas experiencing pollution
                    or other environmental stresses. Additionally,
                    we employ Geographic Information System
                    (GIS) techniques to collect and analyze in-situ
                    sensor data, creating maps of water quality
                    parameters and developing predictive
                    models. This integration of GEE and GIS
                    technology provides us with a comprehensive
                    understanding of water quality dynamics,
                    enabling us to guide effective environmental
                    management strategies. Our project brochure
                    showcases the results and insights gained
                    from monitoring various lakes, demonstrating
                    the power of these technologies in
                    safeguarding water resources.
